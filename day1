Hint
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]


class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0;
        int m = 0;
        int  j = nums.size()-1;
        while(m <= j){
            switch(nums[m]){
                case 0:
                swap(nums[m], nums[i]);
                i++;
                m++;
                break;
                case 1:
                 m++;
                 break;
                case 2:
                swap(nums[m], nums[j]);
                j--;
                break;
            }
        }
        
    }
};
